      <description>This post is just me trying to understand what the near-term future might mean in terms of AI progress. All of this is highly personal - I&amp;rsquo;m mostly writing this to reread it in 5 years and to see how it turned out.
I think AI becoming smart enough to replace most of today&amp;rsquo;s work in engineering and manufacturing is a possible scenario that might occur in the next decade. I have no idea what it will do to our society and life.</description>

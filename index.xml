      <title>Grappling with AI progress</title>

      <description>This post is just me trying to understand what the near-term future might mean in terms of AI progress. All of this is highly personal - I&amp;rsquo;m mostly writing this to reread it in 5 years and to see how it turned out.
The short summary: I think AI will soon be smart enough to replace most of today&amp;rsquo;s work in engineering and manufacturing. I have no idea what it will do to our society and life.</description>

      <title>How to Decarbonize</title>

      <description>The target of this post is to build a baseline mental model of energy supply and CO2 reduction on a country-wide level. Be warned that &amp;ldquo;baseline model&amp;rdquo; is way less than a detailed expert model: the model serves as a robust rough guide to the state of the world, but there are a lot of small details missing. 1
My summary is that an (allmost) CO2-neutral society is feasible with today&amp;rsquo;s technology and in reach within 20 years or so.</description>

      <description>(Crosspost: Reddit, includes comments + discussion. Reading length: maybe 5..10 minutes. Sorry for the messy structure: my thinking is not organized, so my writeup shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be either.)
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot lately. After discussing this with several people I trust, I find the answers I have come up with still lacking and I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate feedback and pointers to things I&amp;rsquo;m missing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been struck recently with how bad large organizations are at getting stuff done.</description>

      <description>I spent some time reading up on economics and figured I might as well just write a summary. Quick warnings:
 Reading time: 30 minutes for the post, 5h+ if you follow all links. I highly recommend following the links. At least pick a few interesting ones. I mostly buy into a pro-market view here. If you are very much against capitalism per se, this post will probably not be worth your time.</description>

      <description>Attention conservation notice: ~5400 words split over parts prologue, part 1, part 1.5, part 2 and summary
This is a review I wrote for the SlateStarCodex / AstralCodexTen book review contest. For whatever reason, it never arrived in the pile of contestants, so I’m posting it here instead. This is OK for me: I mostly wrote this for myself and really did enjoy the process. Nonetheless, I’d like others to read it and get some feedback on it (use the comment function here).</description>
